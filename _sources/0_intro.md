## Introduction

The British Columbia Ungauged Basin database is intended to support water resources research, namely in the optimization of the British Columbia streamflow monitoring network.  


## Notes

There are several ways to use the information provided in this repository.

1.  A minimal dataset containing basin attributes and pour points for nearly 1 million basins in and around British Columbia.  This file does not contain basin polygons since these require very large disk space and we cannot host the data.
2.  An expanded set of compressed (parquet?) files containing the above, plus accompanying basin polygons, for a total of approximately 60 GB.
3.  A set of notebooks demonstrating the complete process of generating basin polygons for the purpose of extracting basin attributes.  The demonstration is carried out on a smaller region (Vancouver Island). 

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

1. How do I do this for other regions?

2. I get an error doing *X*, how do I fix it?
